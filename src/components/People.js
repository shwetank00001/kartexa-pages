            At first, I was a bit sceptical about this website but I still signed up. The counsellors welcomed me warmly and they treated my concerns with great priority. After about 8 months of great sessions, I feel I am a changed person and my life has improved vastly. My personal favourite DOST is Candice â€“ she is one of the best counsellors here. I am a proud user of this platform and I would like to step forth and say that you should try it as you will not be disappointed on this website.
